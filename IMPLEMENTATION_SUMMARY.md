# Implementation Summary: JSON Test Data for Login, Profile View & Edit

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Mock Data System** (`src/app/mock/mock-data.ts`)

  - Priya Sharma (Host)
  - Ravi Kumar (Member)

  - Shows registered events (upcoming)
  - Shows attended events (past)
  - Includes role (organizer/attendee)

- **User Communities Mapping**: Community memberships for each user
  - Different roles per community (admin, moderator, member)
  - Join dates and member counts

- Data is stored in localStorage (not secure)
- No real authentication tokens
- All data is mock/simulated
- DO NOT use in production

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to extend this further:

1. **Add More Test Users**: Expand `MOCK_USERS` array
2. **Add Profile Pictures**: Use avatar URLs or initials
3. **Event Details**: Link events to full event pages
4. **Community Links**: Make communities clickable
5. **Password Validation**: Add password strength requirements
6. **Remember Me**: Add checkbox to persist login longer
7. **Logout Functionality**: Test logout and session clearing

## 💡 Tips

- Each user has unique data (events, communities)
- Try different accounts to see variety
- Profile edits are saved in localStorage
- Refresh the page to test session persistence
- Use admin account to see platform management view
- Check browser console for any errors
